Abstract
====
Approximately one in three people over the age of 65 suffer from hearing loss Hearing assistive devices are the only 
available and validated management options for patients with hearing loss. To increase level of satisfaction and 
benefits of such devices, it is imperative to understand the factors that lead people to use their hearing aids more 
frequently and efficiently. As a result, an interpretable model can be utilised which can make predictions based on 
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), as well as explaining the reasoning behind certain decisions made. It is important to note, 
however, that interpretable models, such as the Neural Additive Model (NAM), are often criticized for having poor 
predictive capabilities, and may be further improved to match the prediction performance of DNNs. By integrating an 
interpretable additive model - NAM - and a post-hoc XAI method - SHAP - into the SHapley Additive Model (SHAM), it is 
possible to create an interpretable model that is more accurate than NAM alone in predicting future hearing aid usage, 
while maintaining its inherent interpretability. This study also demonstrates that SHAM is able to match the performance 
of other state-of-the-art interpretable models.
